/*
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

// :TODO: it is panding, I can not imagine how to compare properly. I will do it later.
char* longestCommonPrefix(char** strs, int strsSize) {
    
}


int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    
    return 0;
